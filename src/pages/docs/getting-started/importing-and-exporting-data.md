Postman can import and export Postman data, including collections, environments, data dumps, and globals. Postman can also import non-Postman data in the form of API schemas to help you consolidate your API development workflow.

## Importing data into Postman

You can import collections or your API specifications directly into Postman.

To import your data into Postman, select **Import** in upper left:

![Import data into Postman](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/import-export-import-ui-v9-6.jpg)

You can import your data from files, folders, links, raw text, or code repositories.

### Importing Postman data

You can import Postman data you exported earlier, including collections, environments, data dumps, and globals.

1. Select **Import** in the left navigation menu.
1. Select your file or folder, input your link, paste your raw text, or [import from GitHub](#importing-from-github-repositories). Postman will automatically recognize Postman data, confirming the name, format, and what the file will import as.
   ![Import collection and environment](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/import-export-github-files-confirm.jpg)
1. Select the files you want to import.
1. Select **Import** to bring your data into Postman.

### Converting Postman collections from v1 to v2

Postman no longer supports the collection v1 format and will return an error if you import a collection in this format.

You can convert your collection's format from v1 to v2 to import it into Postman:

1. In the terminal of your choice, enter the following command to install the Postman Collection Transformer.

   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g postman-collection-transformer
   ```

1. Convert an individual Postman Collection from v1 to v2 by entering the command below.

   ```bash
   postman-collection-transformer convert -i <path to the input Postman Collection file> -o <path to the downloaded Postman file> -j 1.0.0 -p 2.0.0 -P
   ```

The resulting collection will download to your target file path in v2 format.

You can retrieve a list of convert options by running the command with the ``-h`` flag:

   ```bash
   postman-collection-transformer convert -h
   ```

See the [Postman Collection Transformer](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-collection-transformer) for more information on the collection conversion.

### Importing API specifications

To import your API specifications into Postman, see [Importing an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/).

### Importing from GitHub repositories

> You must sign in to a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/#signing-up-for-a-postman-account) to use this feature.

You can import data in bulk from a GitHub repository.

1. In Postman, select **Import** > **Code repository** > **GitHub**.

1. Confirm your GitHub account and **Authorize postmanlabs** to access your repositories.

1. In Postman, select your GitHub organization, repository, and branch, then select **Continue**.

1. Select the files you want to import into Postman. You can also select **Generate collection from imported APIs** and select what you want to link this collection as. Select **Show advanced settings** to control how Postman generates collections based on your file types, then select **Import**.

   ![Confirm import from github](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/import-export-github-files-confirm.jpg)

You will receive a confirmation once the import has completed. You can view your imported files and generated collections in Postman.

### Importing from Bitbucket repositories

> You must sign in to a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/#signing-up-for-a-postman-account) to use this feature.

You can import data in bulk from a Bitbucket repository.

1. In Postman, select **Import** > **Code repository** > **Bitbucket**.

1. Confirm your Bitbucket account and **Authorize Postman** to access your repositories.

1. In Postman, select your Bitbucket workspace, repository, and branch, then select **Continue**.

1. Select the files you want to import into Postman. You can also select **Generate collection from imported APIs** and select what you want to link this collection as. Select **Show advanced settings** to control how Postman generates collections based on your file types, then select **Import**.

You will receive a confirmation once the import has completed. You can now view your newly imported files and generated collections in Postman.

### Importing from GitLab repositories

> You must sign in to a [Postman account](/docs/getting-started/postman-account/#signing-up-for-a-postman-account) to use this feature.

You can import data in bulk from a GitLab repository.

1. In Postman, select **Import** > **Code repository** > **GitLab**.

You can import data in bulk from a Azure DevOps repository. Before you begin, make sure to enable third-party application access for your organization. If you don't enable third-party access, Postman won't be able to connect to your repo. In Azure DevOps, go to your [organization settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-application-access-policies?view=azure-devops), select **Policies**, and turn on the toggle next to **Third-party application access via OAuth**.

You will receive a confirmation once the import has completed. You can now view your newly imported files and generated collections in Postman.

## Exporting Postman data

You can export your Postman data, including collections, environments, data dumps, and globals, as JSON files. You can import these files back into any Postman instance, or use them with [Newman](/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/), Postman's command-line collection runner.

### Exporting collections

1. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection, then select **Export**.

   <img alt="Export collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/export-collection-v9.1.jpg" width="350px" />

The [Export page](http://go.postman.co/me/export) shows information about your export request, including the file size, the date the export expires, and the statuses of your requested data exports. Possible statuses are:

* **Scheduled** - The export request is placed.
