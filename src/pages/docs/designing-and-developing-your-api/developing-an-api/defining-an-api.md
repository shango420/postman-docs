You create the structure of your API using the _API definition_. The API definition can consist of one or multiple files. If your API doesn't have a definition, you can import a definition or start with a boilerplate sample definition.

> Postman supports OpenAPI (versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1), RAML (0.8 and 1.0), Protobuf (2 and 3), GraphQL, or WSDL (1.0 and 2.0) definitions. OpenAPI definitions can be JSON or YAML. RAML definitions must be YAML. Protobuf definitions are PROTO files. GraphQL definitions can be JSON or GraphQL SDL. WSDL definitions must be XML.

## Generating an API definition

If your API doesn't have a definition, you can generate an example definition that you can edit.

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. On the API's overview, under **Definition**, select **Create Definition**.
1. Select **Author Definition from scratch**.
1. Select a definition type and format.
1. Select the **Use a Boilerplate in this Definition** option if you want to start with a sample definition.

    <img alt="Generating an API definition" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-author-definition-v10.jpg" width="323px"/>

1. Select **Create Definition**.

## Importing an API definition

You can import a file into your API to define your API.

To import an API definition:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. On the API's overview, under **Definition**, select **Create Definition**.
1. Select **Import Definition**.
1. Select the file you want to import.
1. Select **Use this Definition** next to the API definition you want to use.

> You can also import an API from a folder, a link, a code repository, or an API gateway. Learn more about [importing an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/).

## Editing an API definition file

To edit an API definition, select an API in the sidebar to expand it, then select **Definition**. Select an API definition file in the sidebar to open it for editing.

> You can also edit your definition from your API's overview. Under **Definition**, select **View files**.

The left pane of the editor displays an outline of your API definition. When you first open the editor, the top level nodes are expanded, and you can select a node to expand or collapse it. Select an element in the outline to jump to it in the editor. You can also select the API definition outline icon <img alt="API definition outline icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-schema-outline-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"/> to hide or show the outline.

<img alt="Editing an API definition" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-edit-definition-v10.jpg"/>

In the API definition editor, when you hover over a `#ref` component and press **⌘** or **Ctrl**, a popup window displays the first 200 characters of the reference component. Select the component while pressing **⌘** or **Ctrl** to jump to the reference location.

<img alt="Jumping to a reference location" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-ref-jump-v10.jpg"/>

In the upper right of the API definition editor are options to beautify the content, wrap text, copy, change the file format, and search. When you finish editing your API definition, select **Save**.

<img alt="API Builder editing options" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-edit-options-v10.jpg"/>

> Postman will indicate any [validation errors](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/validating-elements-against-schema/) as you work on your API definition.

## Working with multi-file API definitions

Your API definition can span multiple files and folders. This is called a _multi-file API definition_. Multi-file API definitions are supported in OpenAPI 3.0 and Protobuf 2.0 and 3.0 APIs.

A multi-file API definition consists of the following components:

* **API Definition** - The entire definition of the API, combining all files within it.
* **Files** - One or more files that specify the API definition.
* **Root file** - The top-level file that hosts the operations defined by the API. See below for more information on root files.
* **Folders** - You can create folders within an API definition to organize files. (You can also add folders within folders.)

> Multi-file API definitions don't support the schema sync integration. Instead, use [API version control](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/versioning-an-api-overview/) to sync with a repository.

<!-- -->

> You can't manage a multi-file API definition using the Postman API.

### About root files

An API definition's root file contains references to other files in the API definition. If you made a tree diagram of the relationships between all files in an API definition, the root file would be the file at the top of the tree. When you [create a new API definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/) or [import an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/), Postman determines the root file based on the references across the files. API definitions don't support references which are external links or present within a separate API.

For OpenAPI 3.0 API definitions, Postman detects root files based on the content and references within files while importing or creating an API definition. You can't set a file as root for OpenAPI 3.0. OpenAPI can have one root file. If you delete the root file, Postman will recalculate the next candidate for the root file automatically.

For Protobuf API definitions, while importing the API, Postman detects all files which have service definitions present in them and marks one as the root. You can set another file as root if there's more than one candidate for root file. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to a Protobuf file in the sidebar and select **Mark as root**.

### Editing a multi-file API definition

To edit a multi-file API definition, select an API in the sidebar to expand it, then select **Definition**. If your definition contains folders, select a folder in the sidebar to expand it and see its contents. Select a file to open it for editing.

### Adding files and folders

You can add files and folders to a multi-file API definition. In the sidebar, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to **Definition**, then select **Add file** or **Add folder**.

<img alt="Adding a file to an API" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-builder-add-file-v10.jpg" width="382px"/>

To add a file to a folder, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to a folder, then select **Add file**. You can rearrange files and folders by dragging them in the sidebar. You can also rename or delete a file or folder by selecting the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px">.

> When you add a file to a single-file Open API 3.0 definition, or to a Protobuf 2.0 or 3.0 definition, it's converted to a multi-file API definition. The existing definition file becomes the root file.

### Deleting files and folders

To delete a file or folder, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the item and select **Delete**.

> If you delete the last remaining file in an API definition, the API will no longer have a definition unless you create it again. The schema documentation and any information in the file's info pane including the definition ID will be lost. Other components of the API will remain intact. For example, collections in the API won't be deleted. You can't restore a definition after it's deleted.

## Viewing rule violations in your API definition

> [This feature is only available for Postman Enterprise teams.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)

As you create your API definition in the editor, Postman automatically checks it against [API Governance and API Security](/docs/api-governance/api-governance-overview/) rules configured for your team. Postman displays any rule violations below the editor. Resolving these issues enables you improve your API definition.

<img alt="OpenAPI 3.0 rule violations" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-definition-rule-violations-openapi3-v10.jpg" width="800px"/>

To learn more about the supported API description formats, the rules preconfigured in Postman, and how to create new rules, see [Rule violations in the API definition](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/).

To see any rule violations, select **Rule** next to **Violations found in definition**. Postman displays each rule violation on its own line, with a brief description of the issue, the rule type (**Governance** or **Security**), and the line and file the where the rule violation occurs. When you select a rule violation, Postman highlights the section of the definition that triggered it.

If the rule violation occurs more than once, the line indicates how many times. You can scroll through each occurrence.

<img alt="Multiple occurrences of the same rule violation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-definition-multiple-violations-v10.jpg" width="800px"/>

To learn more about the rule violation and get information about how to fix it, select **Possible fix**, which will open the relevant Learning Center page.

When you make updates to your API definition, Postman re-checks it. If your changes resolve the issue, Postman removes the rule violation from the list.

### Hiding rule violations

To hide a rule violation for the API definition, select **Hide** next to the rule. Select a reason that you want to hide the rule, then select **Hide** again. This will hide the rule for your entire team on the current API.

> To hide a rule violation globally, you can use either [configurable API Governance rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) or [configurable API Security rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-security-rules/).

<img alt="Hide a rule violation in your API definition" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/api-definition-hide-rule-violation-v10.jpg" width="800px"/>

When you or another member of your team has hidden a rule violation, Postman shows a message in the editor's **Rule** tab to indicate how many are hidden. To turn a rule back on later:

1. Select **Review**.
1. Review your hidden rules and select the eye icon <img alt="Eye icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/eye.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the one you want to turn back on.
