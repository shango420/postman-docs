Your API in Postman can include more than an API definition. You can add elements such as collections to help you document and test your API.

<!-- To add an element, it must be in the same workspace as your API. The element will inherit the [roles and permissions](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/) of the API you are adding it to. -->

> When you add a collection, an independent copy of the collection is added to the API. The copy in the API will no longer be in sync with the original. If you move or delete an API, any collections contained in the API are moved or deleted with it.

## Adding a collection

Add a collection to document your API or help others test your API's endpoints. You can add an existing collection or generate a new collection from your API definition.

> You can also add a test suite to your API. Learn more about [testing an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/testing-an-api/).

### Adding a new collection

To add a new collection to your API:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. On the API's overview, next to **Collections**, select **+** and select **Add new collection**.
1. Enter a new name for the collection.

### Adding an existing collection

To add an existing collection to your API:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. On the API's overview, next to **Collections**, select **+** and select **Copy existing collection**.
1. Select an available collection and select **Copy Collection**.

The copy of the collection displays on your API's overview and under your API in the sidebar. To view documentation for the collection, expand the collection and select **View full documentation**.

### Generating a collection

To generate a new collection from your API definition:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. On the API's overview, next to **Collections**, select **+** and select **Generate from definition**.
1. Change any settings to customize the new collection.
1. Select **Generate Collection**.

The collection displays on your API's overview and under your API in the sidebar. To view documentation for the collection, expand the collection and select **View full documentation**.

> You can also generate a collection when you import an API. For more information, see [importing an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/).
<!--
## Adding an environment

An environment is a set of related variables you can use in Postman requests. Add an environment to resolve any variables used in the collections linked to your API.

To add an environment to your API:

1. Select **Environments** in the left sidebar.
1. In the sidebar, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to an environment and select **Add to API**.
1. Select the **API** you want to add the environment to, then select **Add environment**.

This makes a copy of the environment in your API, which is not synced with the original. The environment displays under your API in the sidebar. Select the environment to view or add variables. Learn more about [managing environments](/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/). -->

## Forking a collection

Collections added to an API can't be used with monitors, mock servers, or CI integrations. To use a collection in an API with these features, you must fork the collection.

To fork a collection from an API:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. Select the collection in the sidebar.
1. Select the fork icon <img alt="Fork icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-fork.jpg#icon" width="14px"> at the upper right.

> Learn more about [forking elements](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control/#forking-postman-entities) in Postman.

## Deleting elements from an API

You can delete a collection from your API.

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. In the sidebar, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to a collection and select **Delete**.

> You can also delete a collection by selecting the delete icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-delete-v9.jpg#icon" width="12px"> next to a collection on the API's overview.
