## System requirements

The Postman CLI supports the same operating system requirements as the Postman desktop app. For a complete list of system requirements, see [Installing and updating Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/).

## Linux installation

Run the following command to install the Postman CLI for the latest Linux version. This will download an install script and run it. The install script creates a `/usr/local/bin` directory if it doesn't exist yet, then installs a `postman` binary there.

``` bash
curl -o- "https://dl-cli.pstmn.io/install/linux64.sh" | sh
```

## Mac (Apple chip) installation

Run the following command to install the Postman CLI for Macs with Apple M1/M2 chips. This will download an install script and run it. The install script creates a `/usr/local/bin` directory if it doesn't exist yet, then installs a `postman` binary there.

``` bash
curl -o- "https://dl-cli.pstmn.io/install/osx_arm64.sh" | sh
```

## Mac (Intel) installation

Run the following command to install the Postman CLI for Macs with Intel chips. This will download an install script and run it. The install script creates a `/usr/local/bin` directory if it doesn't exist yet, then installs a `postman` binary there.

``` bash
curl -o- "https://dl-cli.pstmn.io/install/osx_64.sh" | sh
```

## Windows installation

Run the following commands to install the Postman CLI for Windows. This will download an install script and run it. The install script creates a `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Postman CLI` directory if it doesn't exist yet, then installs a `postman` binary there. The install script also adds `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Postman CLI` to the `PATH` environment variable.

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://dl-cli.pstmn.io/install/win64.ps1'))"
```
