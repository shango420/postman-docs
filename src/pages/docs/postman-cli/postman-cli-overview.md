The Postman CLI is a secure command-line companion for Postman. It is secured and supported by Postman. The Postman CLI enables you to:

* Run a collection with its collection ID or path.
* Send run results to Postman by default.
* Supports log in and log out.
* Check API definitions against configured API Governance and API Security rules

## Deciding which command-line companion to use

Both the Postman CLI and Newman enable you to run and test collections directly from the command line. One may be a better fit than the other, depending on your use case or preferences.

For example, assume you already manage your own security for open-source software, and you want to run collections from a script. Also assume you want visibility into any software you build into your CI/CD pipeline. Newman would be a good fit for this use case because Newman's repository is public and Newman isn't signed or secured by Postman.

Here's another example. Assume you don't already support or secure any open-source software, and you want any software you use to be signed and secured by its developer. The Postman CLI would be a good fit for this use case because the Postman CLI is signed and secured by Postman.
