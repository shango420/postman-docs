This section describes the steps to migrate your team to the latest version of Postman.

Postman v10 provides a consistent, improved API development experience. The Postman desktop app and the [Postman web app](/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/#using-the-postman-web-app) are equally empowering—which one you use is a matter of preference for your workflows.

> Postman v9.4 is the last version of Postman that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. All versions of Postman following v9.4 will only work on 64-bit Windows. You can continue to use Postman v9.4 and earlier on 32-bit Windows.

## Updating to Postman v8

### Updating to v8 as an individual

Non-team users on v7 can update to v8 by navigating to **Settings** and selecting **Update**, then **Download update**.

It's important to make sure your work is synced so that no data is lost during the update. Select __Verify Sync__.

### Updating to v8 as a team

Team members on v7 can update to v8 by navigating to **Settings** and selecting **Update**, then **Download update**. You don't need an approval from an admin to update from v7 to v8.

> If you're on a team and download Postman v8 while the rest of your team is using Postman v7, you will still be able to use v8. Syncing and collaboration won't be affected.

## Installing earlier versions of Postman

If you'd like to downgrade to Postman v9 or below to continue working with a team that hasn't migrated yet, you can download an earlier version of Postman.
