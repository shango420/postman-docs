## Billing dashboard

The Postman [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing) enables you to manage your team's billing.

### Viewing billing overview

The billing overview is your billing dashboard's default view. You can view the details of your Postman plan, including your subscription cycle and a calculation of your expected cost upon renewal.

<img alt="Billing overview" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-plan-and-payments-dash-v9.14.jpg" />

### Managing add-ons

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Resource usage** on the left to view your team's usage of mock servers, monitoring, custom domains, image and file storage, the Postman API, serverless requests, integrations, and the Postman Cloud Agent.

<img alt="Add-ons usage and purchase" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/resource-usage-9.13.jpg" />

> Select **View detailed usage** next to **Monitoring Usage** to view your team's active monitors and their impact on your team's usage during the current billing period.

You can opt to allow or disallow overages for mock server and monitor usage by selecting **Pay-as-you-go** for each item. If enabled, you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

You can also [Purchase Add-ons](#purchasing-add-ons).

> If your API development pipeline is dependent on Postman monitoring, disabling overages may cause unintended consequences for your bill. To avoid fluctuating pay-as-you-go charges, consider adding [pre-paid monitoring blocks](#purchasing-add-ons) to your team plan.

### Viewing account history

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments** on the left, then **History**.

<img alt="Account history view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-history-v9.1.jpg" />

Items such as updates to your Postman subscription, payment method changes, payments, and charges are all listed in chronological order.

### Viewing past invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments** on the left, then **Invoices**. You can get a copy of your past invoices by selecting the download icon <img alt="Download icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-download-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"/> for the specific invoice you want to retrieve.

<img alt="Invoices view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-invoices-v9.1.jpg" />

To add or edit the information on an invoice, see [adding custom information to invoices](#adding-custom-information-to-invoices).

## Payments

Postman offers various payment options dependent on your plan type.

### Managing payment methods

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments** on the left, then **Payment methods**.

To add a new payment method, select **Add Payment Method**. Select the payment method you would like to use. Depending on your location, you can pay using credit card, [direct debit](#setting-up-direct-debit-payments), or other payment methods.

To remove a payment method, hover over the payment method in question and select **Delete Payment Method**.

To set a payment method as your primary, hover over it and select **Set as Primary**.

<img alt="Payment methods view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/payment-methods-page.jpg" />

#### Setting up direct debit payments

> The option to pay with direct debit is only available for customers in the United States.

Postman accepts direct debit payments, in which payment funds are taken directly from a linked bank account using ACH.

To use direct debit as your payment method:

1. Select **Add payment method**, then select **ACH Direct Debit**.
1. Enter your email, your name, and either enter or search for your bank name.

    > This process will verify your bank account immediately. If you want to use a manual verification process instead, see [Verifying your bank account manually](#verifying-your-bank-account-manually).

1. To accept the Terms and Privacy Policy,  select **Agree**. You can select **Learn more** to view the whole policy.
1. Stripe, the payment service Postman uses, will open a new window where you can log into your bank account. Select **Continue**.
1. Select the account you want to use, then select **Link account**. After Stripe verifies the account, select **Done**. Stripe will return you to the Postman billing dashboard.
1. Select **Add account**.

After account verification, Postman will send you a confirmation email. It can take up to four days to withdraw funds from your bank account using direct debit.

> * **Direct debit payment failures** - In the event of a direct debit payment failure, Postman will email you with information about how to fix the issue. The billing dashboard will also contain this information.
> * **Direct debit disputes** - If you believe there has been an error with your direct debit payment, contact [Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) to resolve the issue. If you dispute the payment through your bank, Stripe removes your bank account's verified status and you won't be able to use the account for Postman payments until you [verify it](#setting-up-direct-debit-payments) again.

#### Verifying your bank account manually

You can choose to verify your bank account manually instead of using the automatic process documented in [Setting up direct debit payments](#setting-up-direct-debit-payments). This manual process may take up to two days.

1. Select **Add payment method**, then select **ACH Direct Debit**.
1. Enter your email and your name, then select **Enter bank details manually instead**.
1. Enter your routing number and bank account number. Confirm your account number, then select **Continue**.

In one to two business days, Stripe will make a small test deposit into your bank account that you will use to verify your bank account and will email you with further instructions. To verify your account:

1. After the test deposit arrives in your bank account, go back to the Postman billing dashboard. Select **Plans and payments** > **Payment methods**.
1. Hover over the bank account and select **Verify**.
1. Under **Enter code**, paste the six digit transaction code from the test deposit. Select **Verify**.
1. Select **Confirm** to accept the Terms and Privacy Policy.

> If you don't verify your account within ten days, Postman will delete your bank account information. If you want to add a direct debit payment method later, you will need to re-enter your bank account information.

After your bank account is verified, Postman will send you a confirmation email. It can take up to four days to withdraw funds from your bank account using direct debit.

### Using the Pay Now option

In some circumstances, including an overdue or [failed payment](#failed-payments), you may receive an invoice for your Postman payment. From the invoice, select **Pay Now** to pay immediately using your primary [payment method](#managing-payment-methods), or Apple Pay or Google Pay if supported.

### Paying by invoice

> Invoicing is available for Postman [Enterprise teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) only. If you are a new Enterprise customer, contact the [Postman Sales team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/get-started-postman-plans/) to get started. You will receive a response within three business days. If you are an existing Enterprise customer, submit a request to the [Postman Support team](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us) to be invoiced instead of automatically charged.

You can pay invoices online, with ACH, or with wire transfer. Postman sends invoices to the billing email address listed in your [billing details](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/billing-details). The invoice includes offline payment instructions. View your pending payments in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

### Adding custom information to invoices

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), select **Plan and payments** on the left, then **Invoices**. Select **Edit billing information**.

Add or update your company name, billing email, address, and your VAT ID if applicable, then select **Save**. All future [invoices](https://go.postman.co/billing/invoices) will have the updated copy. To change an existing invoice, submit a request to [Postman support](https://support.postman.com/hc/en-us).

<img alt="Edit billing details" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/update-billing-details-v9.jpg" width="500px"/>

### Failed payments

If you have a payment method on file, Postman will automatically attempt three times to charge it. If this is unsuccessful, [Billing team members](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) receive an email notification. Use the link in the email to access and pay for your [invoice](#using-the-pay-now-option).

If payment is unsuccessful, Postman offers a grace period of 21 days to avoid service disruption. For invoice-based teams, this means 21 days following the due date listed on the invoice.

In the event of non-payment and service deactivation, Postman sends an email notification to the billing email address listed in your [billing details](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/billing-details).

## Team and plan changes

You can change your team's plan and billing cycle in your [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview).

### Changing your plan

To change your plan right away, open your [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) and select **Edit Plan** on the right.

<img alt="Edit plan page" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-edit-plan-v9.1.jpg"/>

You can opt to apply changes right away or on renewal. You can adjust your team size, billing frequency, and plan type. Select **Next** to adjust your team's add-ons, including monitoring blocks, mock server blocks, and custom domains. Select **Next** to then **Confirm Changes**. Postman will send an email notification about the plan change to the billing email address listed in your [billing details](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/billing-details).

The cost of your new plan and any new seats, if applicable, are prorated based on the time left in your team's billing cycle.

> To upgrade to Postman Enterprise, [contact Postman's sales team](mailto:sales@postman.com).

<!-- -->

> Certain changes can only be applied to your team upon renewal. If you make adjustments to your plan that can't be applied right away, and have **Immediately** selected, you will be prompted to switch your selection to **On renewal**.

### Changing billing cycle

Monthly teams can switch to an annual plan at any time by navigating to the [billing dashboard](https://go.postman.co/billing/overview) and selecting **Edit Plan** on the right.

Select to pay **Monthly** or **Annual** and confirm your changes. Note that annual teams can only switch to a monthly plan at the end of their current billing cycle. You can find the end date of your current billing cycle under **Overview**. Postman will send an email notification about the billing cycle change to the billing email address listed in your [billing details](http://go.postman.co/settings/team/billing-details).

<img alt="Edit plan billing frequency" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-dashboard-edit-plan-billing-frequency-v9.1.jpg" width="400px"/>

### Purchasing add-ons

The base number of monitoring requests, mock server calls, and custom domains included in your plan depends on your [plan type](https://www.postman.com/pricing). You can allow or disallow overages for monitoring and mock server calls by [managing your team's add-ons](#managing-add-ons). If enabled, you will be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

You can purchase more blocks of monitoring requests, mock server calls, and custom domains by navigating to your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), selecting **Resource usage** on the left, then **Purchase Add-ons** on the right.

<img alt="Add-ons purchase form" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/billing-edit-plan-add-ons-v9.1.jpg"/>

Update the number of monitoring blocks, mock server blocks, and custom domains you would like to have included in your team plan, then select **Next** to confirm your changes.

### Utilizing Auto-Flex

[Auto-Flex](https://learning.postman.com/auto-flex-policy/) is a flexible billing feature available to Postman teams. With Auto-Flex enabled, your team can [invite](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#inviting-users) users without having to pay in advance for more seats, then opt to retain or remove them before being [billed](#billing-for-auto-flex).

All [Postman Basic and Professional plans](https://www.postman.com/pricing) have Auto-Flex enabled automatically.

#### Billing for Auto-Flex

Your Auto-Flex billing cycle is dependent on your team's plan:

* Monthly plans are charged for newly added users on a monthly basis.

* Annual plans are charged for newly added users on a quarterly basis.

At any time during your Auto-Flex billing cycle, your team can [invite](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#inviting-users) users regardless of available seats.

Before your Auto-Flex billing cycle renews, all Billing and Admin team members receive a notification about any new users you added during that time period.

> Annual plans receive a notification two weeks before their quarterly cycle renews, and monthly plans receive a notification one week before their monthly cycle renews.

You can use this reminder to make any necessary changes to your team before the end of your current Auto-Flex cycle, when you will be billed for any newly added users.

> If you have already been billed for the users you added and retained in an earlier Auto-Flex cycle, you can't remove those slots until your plan renews.

You won't be billed if the number of users has remained unchanged during your Auto-Flex cycle, or if you remove any additional users prior to Auto-Flex billing.

> If your team incurs any overages and you have an Auto-Flex bill for that cycle, your invoice will combine your overage charges with your Auto-Flex charges.

In your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing), you can view:

* Your current number of additional team members
* How much you will be billed at the end of your cycle (unless you add or remove team members in the interim)
* Additional information about your Auto-Flex and regular billing cycles

<img alt="Billing overview with auto flex" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/auto-flex-dash-9.14.jpg" />

> [Contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) with any questions about Auto-Flex.

## Canceling your plan

To cancel your Postman plan, select **Cancel plan** at the bottom of your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

If you have canceled your Postman plan and want to reverse this action, select **Undo cancelation** next to the cancelation notice on your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).
