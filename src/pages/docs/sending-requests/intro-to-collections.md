You can group your Postman requests and examples into collections to keep your workspace organized, to collaborate with teammates, to generate API documentation and API tests, and to automate request runs.

Select **Collections** in the sidebar for the list of collections in a workspace.

## Creating collections

There are several ways to create a new collection:

* Select **Collections** in the sidebar, then select **+**.

    <img alt="Create new collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/new-collection.jpg" width="300px"/>

* Select **New**, then select **Collection**.
* Select **Home** in the Postman header. Select **Create New**, then select **Collection**.

Once you have created a new collection, you can customize and configure it:

1. Select the edit icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px"> to give your new collection a name.
1. You can optionally specify a [description](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/) for your collection. Select the documentation icon <img alt="Documentation icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="16px">, then select the edit icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px"> to write your description. This description will appear in its documentation and in the workspace when anyone opens it.
1. Select **Authorization** to configure authorization details for the collection.
1. Select **Pre-request Script** to define a [pre-request script](/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) for your collection, which will run before requests are sent to the server.
1. Select **Tests** to define a [test script](/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/) for your collection, which will run after a response is received.
1. Select **Variables** to define values for [collection variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/) to share across all requests in the collection.

## Managing collections

### Basic actions

From the list of collections in your workspace, you can:

* Select a collection to open its overview in a tab.
* Open and close collection content by selecting the arrow next to the collection name.
* Hover over a collection name and select the star icon &#9733; to move that collection to the top of the list.
* Use the collection search bar to filter through your collections.
* Reorder the requests, folders, and examples inside a collection by dragging and dropping them.

### Adding folders to a collection

To add a folder to your collection:

1. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection name.
1. Select **Add folder**.

You can also add sub-folders to create extra levels of nesting for the collection's requests and examples.

### Deleting a collection

To delete a collection:

1. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection name.
1. Select **Delete**.

You can also select the collection and press **Delete** on your keyboard.

> If a deleted collection is larger than 30 MB, you won't be able to [recover it](#recovering-a-deleted-collection). To avoid this, you can split the collection into smaller pieces before deleting it, or back up the collection first.

### Recovering a deleted collection

To recover a deleted collection:

1. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection search bar.
1. Select **Open Trash**.

    > Alternatively, select <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-delete-v9.jpg#icon" width="12px"> **Trash** from the Postman footer.

1. In the Trash page, select the restore icon <img alt="Restore icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-restore-v9.jpg" width="14px"> next to the collection you want to recover.

> Deleted collections that are larger than 30 MB can't be recovered.

Recovery options depend on your Postman plan:

* Free account: Recover collections for up to one day.
* Postman Basic: Recover collections for up to 30 days.
* Postman Professional and Enterprise: Recover collections for up to 90 days.

> If a collection that you expected to be in the Trash isn't there, it may have been removed from a workspace rather than deleted. If the collection appears in another workspace, you can move it by selecting **Share**.

### Sharing a collection

To share a collection with other users, you can:

* Publish a [Run in Postman](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/creating-run-button/) button.
* Invite others to collaborate by selecting the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection name, then selecting **Share**. Learn more about [sharing elements in Postman](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/#sharing-postman-entities).
* Move the collection to a shared workspace by selecting the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection name, then selecting **Move**. Learn more about [moving Postman elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaborating-in-team-workspaces/#moving-elements-to-team-workspaces).
* ([Enterprise](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)) Add the collection to your team's [Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/#adding-collections).

### Watching a collection

When you watch a collection, Postman notifies you when a workspace team member makes changes to the collection, including adding a new request, modifying the existing requests, adding or updating variables, editing pre-request scripts or tests, and adding or deleting a folder. You can watch a collection that you own, as well as collections in any public workspace.

To watch a collection:

1. Select the watch icon <img alt="Watch icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/eye.jpg#icon" width="16px"> to start watching the collection.

![Collection watching](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/collection-watching-overview-v9.12.jpg)

To view notifications about what has changed in a collection you watch:

1. Select the notifications icon <img alt="Notification icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-notification-bell-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> in the Postman header to view the notification. Select **View changelog** to view the collection's changelog.

    <img alt="Notification Collection Watching" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/collection-watch-notification-v9.19.jpg" width="500px"/>

1. You will also receive an email with the information regarding who made the change, what the change was, and when it was made. Select **View changelog** in the email to access the full changelog in Postman.

> If you create a collection and change it from the same Postman account, you won't receive notifications for any changes you make to that collection.

### Forking a collection

You can fork collections in your own workspace to [develop collection versions](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control-for-collections/). To fork a collection:

1. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection name.
1. Select **Fork**.

> Alternatively, select the fork icon <img alt="Fork icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-fork.jpg#icon" width="14px"> from the collection overview.

### Adding comments to a collection

To add a comment at the collection level:

1. Select the comment icon <img alt="Comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-comments-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> from the right sidebar.
1. Write your comment, then select **Add Comment**.

### Reverting collection changes

To revert your collection to an earlier state:

1. Select the changelog icon <img alt="Changelog icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-changelog-v9.jpg#icon" width="18px"> on the right.
2. Select a session to expand it.
3. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the change you'd like to restore your collection to, then select **Restore to this change**.

    <img alt="Restore from changelog" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/changelog-restore-v9.16.jpg" width="350px"/>

Restoring a collection from the changelog reverts it to the point immediately after your selected change occurred.

### Viewing pull requests, forks, and collection details

From the right sidebar:

* To view pull requests for a collection, select the pull request icon <img alt="Pull request icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-pull-request.jpg#icon" width="16px">
* To view forks created from a collection, select the fork icon <img alt="Fork icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-fork.jpg#icon" width="16px">
* To view more information about the collection, including mock servers, monitors, and integrations, select the information icon <img alt="Information icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-information-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="16px">

## Using collections in development workflows

Collections can power various parts of your API development, testing, and publishing workflows.

* Select **Run** to access the [Collection Runner](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/), which allows you to run all requests in a collection and build testing workflows into your runs.
* Select the documentation icon <img alt="Documentation icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="16px"> to generate [API documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/) from a collection.
* Attaching a [monitor](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/) to a collection lets you schedule collection runs. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection name, and then select **Monitor collection**.
* You can use [mock servers](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/) to return sample data during testing and development. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection name, and then select **Mock collection**.
* Generate collections from API specifications using the [Postman API Builder](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/).

## About multi-protocol request collections

You can also save multi-protocol requests, such as [WebSocket](/docs/sending-requests/websocket/websocket/) and [gRPC](/docs/sending-requests/grpc/grpc-client-overview/) requests, into collections.

Because multi-protocol requests have different features than HTTP requests, when they're saved to a collection, it causes the collection to be in a “beta” state with certain limitations.

When in this state, a collection can only contain WebSocket or gRPC requests, and not HTTP requests. Some features related to collections also aren't supported.
