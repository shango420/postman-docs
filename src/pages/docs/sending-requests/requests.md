You can send requests in Postman to connect to APIs you are working with. Your requests can retrieve, add, delete, and update data. Whether you are building or testing your own API, or integrating with a third-party API, you can send your requests in Postman. Your requests can send parameters, authorization details, and any body data you require.

For example, if you're building a client application (such as a mobile or web app) for a store, you might send one request to retrieve the list of available products, another request to create a new order (including the selected product details), and a different request to log a customer in to their account.

When you send a request, Postman displays the response received from the API server in a way that lets you examine, visualize, and if necessary troubleshoot it.

<img alt="Request builder with a successful response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/postman-request-builder-v10.jpg" width="750px"/>

If you have never sent a request before, check out [sending your first request](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) before you continue.

## Creating requests

Your requests can include multiple details determining the data Postman will send to the API you are working with. Enter a URL and choose a method, then optionally specify a variety of other details.

You can create a new request from the Postman home screen, by using __New__ &gt; __HTTP Request__, or by selecting __+__ to open a new tab.

![Create New Screen](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/new-request-v10.jpg)

Select __Save__ to create your request. You can give your request a name and description, and choose or create a collection to save it in.

Once your new tab is open, you can specify the details you need for your request.

[![New Request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/empty-request-v9.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/empty-request-v9.jpg)

## Adding request detail

If you have a request you want to run, you will need to know the URL, method, and other optional values such as auth and parameters.

To test sending a request in Postman, you can set the URL to the Postman Echo sample API endpoint `https://postman-echo.com/get` and the method to `GET`, then select __Send__.

> Open the __Bootcamp__ in Postman and follow __Designing and mocking APIs__ to import some requests you can use for exploring Postman.

### Setting request URLs

Each request you send in Postman requires a URL representing the API endpoint you are working with. Each operation you can perform using an API is typically associated with an endpoint. Each endpoint in an API is available at a particular URL. This is what you enter into Postman to access the API.

* If you're building an API, the URL will typically be the base location plus path. For example, in the request `https://postman-echo.com/get`, `https://postman-echo.com` is the base URL, and `/get` is the endpoint path.
* If you're using a third-party API, your API provider will supply the URLs you need, for example within their developer documentation.

When you start typing in the URL input field, Postman will present a dropdown list of previously used locations you can use to autocomplete.

> Postman will automatically add `http://` to the start of your URL if you don't specify a protocol.

You can optionally enter _query_ parameters into the URL field, or you can [enter them in the Params tab](#sending-parameters). If your request uses _path_ parameters, [you can enter them directly into the URL field](#sending-parameters).

> You can use [next generation URL encoding](#encoding-your-request-urls) in your requests.

### Selecting request methods

By default Postman will select the `GET` method for new request. `GET` methods are typically for retrieving data from an API. You can use a variety of other methods to send data to your APIs, including the following most common options:

* `POST` — add new data
* `PUT` — replace existing data
* `PATCH` — update some existing data fields
* `DELETE` — delete existing data

<img alt="Request Methods" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/request-methods-v9.jpg" width="300px"/>

For example, if you're working with an API for a To Do list application, you might use a `GET` method to retrieve the current list of tasks, a `POST` method to create a new task, and a `PUT` or `PATCH` method to edit an existing task.

Postman supports a number of extra request methods by default, and you can use custom methods. Select the method dropdown list, edit the method name text, and save your new method. To delete a method, hover over it in the list and select the delete icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-delete-v9.jpg#icon" width="12px">.

> To test the `https://postman-echo.com/get` endpoint, leave the `GET` method selected and select __Send__.

The same location (sometimes called "route") can provide more than one endpoint by accepting different methods. For example, an API might have a `POST` `/customer` endpoint for adding a new customer, and a `GET` `/customer` endpoint for retrieving an existing customer.

* If your request doesn't require parameters or authentication, you can select __Send__ to fetch a response.
* Otherwise, specify your [parameters](#sending-parameters) and any [body data](#sending-body-data) you need to send to the API.
* If you don't need to send data with your request, set up any required [authentication](#authenticating-requests) and [headers](#configuring-request-headers).

### Sending parameters

You can send path and query parameters with your requests using the URL field and the __Params__ tab.

* Query parameters are appended to the end of the request URL, following `?` and listed in key value pairs, separated by `&` using the following syntax: `?id=1&type=new`
* Path parameters form part of the request URL, and are referenced using placeholders preceded by `:` as in the following example: `/customer/:id`

To send a query parameter, add it directly to the URL or open __Params__ and enter the name and value. When you enter your query parameters in either the URL or the **Params** fields, these values will update everywhere they're used in Postman.

> Parameters aren't automatically URL-encoded. Right-click selected text, and choose __EncodeURIComponent__ to manually encode a parameter value.

To send a path parameter, enter the parameter name into the URL field, after a colon, for example `:id`. When you enter a path parameter, Postman will populate it in the __Params__ tab, where you can also edit it.

[![Path Parameter](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/path-param-v9.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/path-param-v9.jpg)

You can add descriptions to your parameters and they'll appear for anyone sharing the request (for example in your workspace) or viewing your API documentation.

> You can use the __Bulk Edit__ option if you prefer to enter your parameters in plain text instead of using the request builder.

If your request doesn't require body data, auth, or headers, select __Send__. Otherwise, set up your [body](#sending-body-data), [auth](#authenticating-requests), and [headers](#configuring-request-headers).

### Sending body data

You will need to send body data with requests whenever you need to add or update structured data. For example, if you're sending a request to add a new customer to a database, you might include the customer details in JSON. Typically you will use body data with `PUT`, `POST`, and `PATCH` requests.

The __Body__ tab in Postman allows you to specify the data you need to send with a request. You can send various different types of body data to suit your API.

> If you're sending body data, make sure you have the correct [headers](#configuring-request-headers) selected to indicate the content type your API may need to process the received data correctly.
>
> * For form-data and urlencoded body types, Postman will automatically attach the correct `Content-Type` header.
> * If you use raw mode for your body data, Postman will set a header based on the type you select (such as text or json).
> * If you manually select a `Content-Type` header, that value will take precedence over what Postman sets.
> * Postman doesn't set any header type for the binary body type.

By default, Postman will select __None__—leave it selected if you don't need to send a body with your request.

Choose the data type you need for your request body—[form data](#form-data), [URL-encoded](#url-encoded), [raw](#raw-data), [binary](#binary-data), or [GraphQL](#graphql).

#### Form data

Website forms often send data to APIs as `multipart/form-data`. You can replicate this in Postman using the `form-data` __Body__ tab. Form data allows you to send key-value pairs, and specify the content type.

[![Form Data](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/form-data-v9.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/form-data-v9.jpg)

> You can attach files using form data. When you repeatedly make API calls that send the same files, Postman will persist your file paths for later use. This also helps you run collections that contain requests requiring file upload. Uploading multiple files each with their own content type isn't supported.

#### URL-encoded

URL-encoded data uses the same encoding as URL parameters. If your API requires url-encoded data, select `x-www-form-urlencoded` in the __Body__ tab of your request. Enter your key-value pairs to send with the request and Postman will encode them before sending.

> There is sometimes confusion between form data and url-encoded. If you are unsure which one you need, check with your API provider.

#### Raw data

You can use raw body data to send anything you can enter as text. Use the __raw__ tab, and the type dropdown list to indicate the format of your data (__Text__, __JavaScript__, __JSON__, __HTML__, or __XML__) and Postman will enable syntax-highlighting as well as appending the relevant headers to your request.

<img alt="Body JSON" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/body-raw-data.jpg" width="500px"/>

> You can set a content type header manually if you need to override the one Postman sends automatically.

You can use [variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/) in your body data and Postman will populate their current values when sending your request.

> To beautify your XML or JSON, select the text in the editor and then select **⌘+Option+B** or **Ctrl+Alt+B**.

#### Binary data

You can use __binary__ data to send information you can't enter manually in the Postman editor with your request body, such as image, audio, and video files (you can also send text files).

#### GraphQL

You can send GraphQL queries with your Postman requests by selecting the __GraphQL__ tab in the request __Body__. Enter your code in the __Query__ area and any variables in the __GraphQL Variables__ section.

Check out [Using GraphQL](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql/) for more information on GraphQL, including how to enable __Autocomplete__ powered by Postman API schemas.

### Authenticating requests

Some APIs require auth details you can send in Postman. Authentication involves confirming the identity of the client sending a request, and authorization involves confirming that the client has permission to carry out the endpoint operation. Open the __Authorization__ tab to configure your access details.

[![Request Auth](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/authorization-tab-v9.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/authorization-tab-v9.jpg)

Postman will automatically include your auth details in the relevant part of the request, for example in __Headers__.

For more detail on implementing different types of auth in your Postman requests, check out [Authorizing requests](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/).

Once your auth and other request details are set up, select __Send__ to run your request.

### Configuring request headers

Some APIs require you to send particular headers along with requests, typically to provide more metadata about the operation you are performing. You can set these up in the __Headers__ tab. Enter any key-value pairs you need and Postman will send them along with your request. As you enter text, Postman prompts you with common options you can use to autocomplete your setup, such as `Content-Type`.

![Header Types](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/presets-v9.jpg)

> You can save commonly used headers together in a header preset. In the __Headers__ tab, select __Presets__, and choose __Manage Presets__. Add each preset by providing a name, and entering the key plus value. Select __Add__ and your preset will be available in the __Presets__ dropdown list. Selecting the preset will autopopulate the fields in your request headers.

#### Autogenerated headers

Postman will automatically add certain headers to your requests based on your request selections and settings. Select __hidden__ at the top of the headers tab for information about what Postman will send with your request.

<img alt="Hidden Headers" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/hidden-headers-button.jpg" width="400px"/>

Hover over a header for details about it. Postman will indicate why the header has been added. The detail will indicate how to deactivate or override a header value if you need to.

<img alt="Host Header" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/autogenerated-host-header-v9.jpg" width="350px"/>

> Deactivating or overriding recommended headers may make your request behave unexpectedly.

If you need to change a header, you can do so in the relevant part of Postman, for example the __Authorization__ tab, the request __Body__, __Cookies__ for the request domain, the __Settings__, and in some cases directly in the __Headers__ tab itself.

[![Token Header](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/headers-added-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/headers-added-v8.jpg)

If you need to go to a different part of the app, Postman will show a link on the right-hand side.

If a header has been added based on your auth setup, [select the __Authorization__ tab](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/) to change it.

To alter cookie headers, [change the cookie setup](/docs/sending-requests/cookies/) for the domain you're sending the request to.

To deactivate an autogenerated header directly in __Headers__, uncheck its checkbox. To override an autogenerated header value, uncheck the autogenerated entry and add a separate entry for the header, listing its name in the __Key__ field and specifying your value in the __Value__ field.

If you have more than one entry for the same header, Postman will indicate which one will be overridden, prioritizing headers you have either explicitly added directly in __Headers__ or indirectly with selections you made in the other parts of your request such as __Authorization__.

For `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` headers, Postman will automatically calculate values when you send your request, based on the data in the __Body__ tab. However, you can override both values.

Once your headers and other request details are set up, you can select __Send__ to run your request.

### Using cookies

You can manage Cookies for your domains from Postman. Select __Cookies__ (under __Send__). For more information, see [Managing cookies](/docs/sending-requests/cookies/).

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/cookies-dialog.jpg" alt="manage cookies dialog" width="450px" />

## Choosing custom settings

You can configure a variety of settings for Postman requests using the request __Settings__ tab. These allow you to apply non-standard logic to your requests.

### Encoding your request URLs

Postman parses and encodes your request URL to maximize the chances of a successful API call. Postman encodes the characters in your URL and maps them to a representation that your API is most likely to accept. The Postman URL processor optimizes the chance of your request being effectively processed by the wide range of server implementations in use.

The processor will encode characters depending on where they occur in the URL:

| URL component | Characters to encode |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Path | `"` `<` `>` `` ` `` `#` `?` `{` `}` `SPACE` |
| Query | `"` `#` `&` `'` `<` `=` `>` `SPACE` |
| Userinfo | `"` `<` `>` `` ` `` `#` `?` `{` `}` `/` `:` `;` `=` `@` `[` `\` `]` `^` | `SPACE` |

The processor is turned on by default in Postman, but you can turn off encoding if you are working with an unusual server implementation. To turn this setting on or off in your request, select __Settings__ &gt; __Encode URL automatically__.

> You can selectively encode parts of your URL by highlighting the text and right-clicking, then choosing __EncodeURIComponent__.

## Troubleshooting your requests

Postman will indicate any whitespace or invalid characters in parts of your request that may not function as expected so that you can rectify your values. Invalid characters are highlighted in the request method, URL (including the path), parameters, headers (including your key names), and body.

<img alt="Invalid Characters" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/invalid-character-message-v9.jpg" width="400px"/>

If Postman isn't able to send your request or doesn't receive a response, you will get a message with details about the error. Select __View in Console__ to get an overview of your request and to help identify the source of the issue.

If your request doesn't work as expected, check out some [troubleshooting tips](/docs/sending-requests/troubleshooting-api-requests/).

## Next steps

Once you have your request set up, select __Send__ and examine the [Response](/docs/sending-requests/responses/).
