By default, you can view Postman elements in [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/) that you share with your team. If you need to edit an element, such as a collection, API, environment, mock server, or monitor, you can request [Editor role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/) access.

To request Editor access for an element, you first need to join or get invited to the [shared workspace](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/) that has the element. After you submit a request for access, the owner of the element will receive a notification asking them to approve the request.

> Roles and permissions are available depending on your [Postman plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing).

## Requesting Editor role access

If you can view an element in a workspace but can't edit it, there is a lock icon <img alt="Lock icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-lock.jpg#icon" width="11px"> next to the name of the collection, API, environment, mock server, or monitor.

To request Editor role access for an element:

1. Select **Collections**, **APIs**, **Environments**, **Mock Servers**, or **Monitors** in the sidebar.

1. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the element name and select **Manage Roles**.

1. Select **Request Access**.

Postman will send an email notification to the person you selected. Once they approve your request, you will also get notified by email. Your request will expire after 15 days, after which you can request access again.

## Approving requests for access

If you're an Editor on a Postman element like an API, collection, environment, mock server, or monitor, you may receive a request to give a teammate access to it.

When a teammate requests Editor role access, you will receive an email that details the request. Select **Approve Request** if you want to give your teammate Editor role access to the collection, API, environment, mock server, or monitor. If you don't want to give Editor access, you can ignore the request. The request will expire after 15 days.
